My name is Charles Armstrong but I go by Chuck.  I am a avid tech fanatic and student of the technological arts.  I do consider what we are doing in this industry a form of art in that we are creating and innovating new and exciting items everyday!  I'm fortunate enough to have been born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically San Francisco itself.  So through osmosis and hard fought battles, I have achieved my goal of working in the field that I love.
